# HeroesOfPymoly-Analysis

This project aims to analyze the data of the purchasing department of a video games company through Pandas.

To start the analysis, it was necessary to transform the CSV file data into a data frame and proceed with a short cleaning process where the null values were dropped, and the columns were renamed. 

Then, the primary data frame was breakdown based on variables of interest such as gender, age, purchasing level, popular items, and profits to analyze the data. (Functions like count, unique, mean, sum, group by etc. were used in this section)

The new data frames reflect some insights into consumers' behavior, which provide information to generate some general conclusions included at the end of the report.
